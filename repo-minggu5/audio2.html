			Slip inside the eye of your mind<br>
			Don't you know you might find<br>
			A better place to play<br>
			You said that you'd never been<br>
			But all the things that you've seen<br>
			Slowly fade away<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			So I start a revolution from my bed<br>
			'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head<br>
			Step outside, summertime's in bloom<br>
			Stand up beside the fireplace<br>
			Take that look from off your face<br>
			You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			And so Sally can wait<br>
			She knows it's too late<br>
			As we're walking on by<br>
			Her soul slides away<br>
			But don't look back in anger<br>
			I heard you say<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Take me to the place where you go<br>
			Where nobody knows<br>
			If it's night or day<br>
			But please don't put your life in the hands<br>
			Of a rock and roll band<br>
			Who'll throw it all away<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed<br>
			'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head<br>

			'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out<br>

			I heard you say<br>
			At least not today<br>
